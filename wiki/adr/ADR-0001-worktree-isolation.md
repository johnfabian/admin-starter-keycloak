# Context

The user approved the automation implementation plan in conversation on 2026-09-11.

# Decision

Use a dedicated linked worktree and feature branch per writer, at most two disjoint writers, and one integration owner. OS locking serializes the existing shared local test stack. The alternative shared writing checkout risks overwritten changes; independent service stacks add configuration and resource cost.

# Approval provenance

Accepted on 2026-09-11 by the requesting human user in the Codex conversation (human:requesting-user). The user said: "lets not worrry about orca right now, but the ADRs look good to me".

The approval covers ADR-0001 through ADR-0012 as presented at commit 04e3abe09195516104180fb4f10ba23394cd1f04. It was transcribed into [PR #20](https://github.com/johnfabian/admin-starter-keycloak/pull/20#adr-acceptance---2026-09-11) and exactly reread before acceptance. This is conversation approval recorded by the assistant, not a GitHub review submitted by the human. No GitHub identity is inferred.

Acceptance confirms the architectural choice; it does not claim historical approval, independent runtime verification, production readiness, deployment or PR merge authorization. ORCA is deferred and does not block the accepted workflow.

The previous proposed record remains available at the approved Git revision. Record-ADR skill version: 04e3abe09195516104180fb4f10ba23394cd1f04.

# Supersession

No preceding ADR exists. Preserve this identifier if the decision is later superseded.
